An end-to-end analytics project analyzing ~100k real, anonymized orders (2016–2018) from the [Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce). 

This project covers relational schema design, pre-constraint data validation, data sanitization, analytical SQL modeling (window functions, CTEs, custom aggregation logic), and executive Tableau dashboards. Built as a core portfolio demonstration during a career transition from customs & logistics operations into data analytics.

## Executive Summary & Core Insights

| Domain | Key Metric / Pattern | Operational & Business Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Concentration** | **Top 15 of 73 Categories** generate 80% of total marketplace GMV (Pareto Class A). | Commercial acquisition, supplier onboarding, and campaign budgets should concentrate on Class A categories (`bed_bath_table`, `health_beauty`, `sports_leisure`). |
| **Seller Geography** | **>70% of merchant supply** originates from São Paulo (`SP`), while demand is distributed across all 27 states. | Long-haul interstate line-hauls lead to delivery delays in northern/northeastern states (`PA`, `AM`, `BA`), highlighting opportunities for decentralized fulfillment hubs outside `SP`. |
| **Fulfillment Latency** | **Payment Approval:** ~0.4 days avg.<br>**Merchant Dispatch:** 2.8 days avg. | Automated platform payment approval is fast; fulfillment bottlenecks occur in seller pick, pack, and carrier handover stages. |
| **Seasonality Patterns** | **Year-normalized indexing** reveals predictable annual spikes (e.g., `watches_gifts` peaking in May for Mother's Day and December for Christmas). | Inventory allocation and freight carrier capacity buffers must ramp up 4–6 weeks prior to known demand shifts. |

## Architecture & Data Pipeline

The pipeline processes raw Kaggle CSV files through an ordered series of reproducible SQL scripts in MySQL 8.0:

[Raw CSVs]
│
▼
01_create_database.sql ➔ 02_create_tables.sql
│
▼
03_data_import.sql (LOAD DATA INFILE with NULLIF guards)
│
▼
04_data_import_validation.sql ➔ 05_data_quality_check.sql
│
▼
06_cleaning_data.sql ➔ 07_adding_foreign_keys.sql
│
▼
08_base_views.sql (Central Hub View: vw_sales_analysis)
│
▼
09–13 Domain Scripts ➔ 14_views.sql (Modular Reporting Layer)
│
▼
[Tableau Desktop / Hyper Extracts / Interactive Dashboards]


### Central Hub View Pattern (`vw_sales_analysis`)
All downstream reporting queries read from a central denormalized hub view (`vw_sales_analysis`). This design provides:
1. **Consistent Business Metrics:** Distinct definitions for merchandise sales (`price`) versus total customer outlay (`total_price = price + freight_value`) applied platform-wide.
2. **Prevented Join Fan-Out:** Order reviews are pre-aggregated to the `order_id` grain (`AVG(review_score)`) before joining, preventing duplicate row multiplication on orders with multiple reviews.

---

## Data Quality & Engineering Decisions

* **Composite Primary Key Discovery:** During import validation (`04_data_import_validation.sql`), `order_reviews.review_id` was found to be non-unique across split orders. The schema was updated to use a composite key `PRIMARY KEY (review_id, order_id)`.
* **Malformed CSV Sanitization:** A broken record in `olist_order_reviews_dataset.csv` (row 82,209) contained an unescaped double quote that broke standard ingestion; this was corrected before loading.
* **Chronological Date Auditing:** Discovered instances where `order_delivered_carrier_date < order_approved_at` or estimated delivery preceded purchase. Rather than discarding entire orders and losing revenue data, invalid timestamps were converted to `NULL` to keep financial metrics intact.
* **Empirical Encoding Hypothesis Testing:** Garbled Brazilian city names initially appeared to be a `latin1` vs. `utf8mb4` import issue. A scratch-table re-import using `latin1` confirmed identical text patterns, indicating true spelling variants in the raw source rather than ingestion corruption. As a result, geographic analyses were standardized at the 2-letter state code level (`customer_state`, `seller_state`).
* **Category Translation Referential Integrity:** Missing translations (e.g., `pc_gamer`, `portateis_cozinha...`) and a synthetic `'uncategorized'` placeholder were backfilled before applying foreign key constraints.

Tableau Dashboards Overview
ABC / Pareto Analysis: Dynamic category-level concentration showing cumulative revenue share against an 80% threshold. Clicking a category reveals its Top 5 individual products and category-specific ABC classification.

Logistics & Timeliness: An operational overview pairing high-level KPIs (Lead Time, Dispatch Time, On-Time Delivery Rate, Freight Share) with a synchronized dual-axis chart comparing Payment Approval vs. Dispatch Preparation by seller state, alongside an interstate delivery duration matrix.

Regional Demand: Geographic breakdown of top-selling categories across Brazil with interactive drill-downs into Top 10 customer spending and order frequency per state.

Sellers Performance: Analysis of merchant hubs, state-by-state monthly revenue trends, and top merchant leaderboards.

Trends & Seasonality: Monthly revenue trends paired with a 3-month trailing moving average, month-over-month growth rates, and a year-normalized seasonality index.
